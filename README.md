# PRFPY - Validation Framework

This repository is an extension of ![prfanalyze](https://github.com/vistalab/PRFmodel) implementing ![prfpy](https://github.com/VU-Cog-Sci/prfpy) into the validation framework. This way, we ensure our toolbox is consistent with the other toolboxes already validated in ![this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007924).
